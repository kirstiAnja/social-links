## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
In this project I tried out flex and grid, but I am still not comfortable using with it, dont understand quite where to use what... or what is the difference between them. 

### Continued development
I am still having trouble with centering stuff, so need to dig deeper into this. I am also very unsecure about reseponsive webpages , so it to  needs to be dug into.
Continiue practise the basics, building muscle memory..

### Useful resources
